# Advent of Code 2023

Like many others, I've decided to participate in the Advent of Code 2023 challenge. That said, I'm running a bit behind as I'm starting this on the 6th of December.

Let's A go!

I suspect most of my solutions will be in PowerShell, but I may try to mix it up and do other languages too.
